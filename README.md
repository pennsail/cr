# Carbon-Aware Computing Research

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation code for our HPCA paper submission on carbon-aware computing systems.

## Structure

- **[deferrable/](deferrable/)** - Implementation and evaluation of carbon-aware scheduling for deferrable workloads
- **[realtime/](realtime/)** - Implementation and evaluation of power-capping for real-time workloads

## Getting Started

Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific setup and usage instructions:

- See [deferrable/README.md](deferrable/README.md) for deferrable workload experiments
- See [realtime/README.md](realtime/README.md) for real-time workload experiments

## Paper Submission

This code accompanies our HPCA paper submission under review. The repository has been anonymized for the review process.
